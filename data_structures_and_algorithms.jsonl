Quicksort selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays according to whether elements are less than or greater than the pivot, and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays. Mergesort divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together. Quicksort is generally faster in practice but has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), while mergesort has a guaranteed time complexity of O(n log n)." }]}

It provides a more accurate measure of the overall performance of an algorithm. This is particularly useful when certain operations are expensive but infrequent, and the cost is spread out over many operations.
